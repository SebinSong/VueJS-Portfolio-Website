#Portfolio Website-Sebin Song.

Personal Portfolio Website created using Vue.js. (SASS/SVG/Canvas/Greensock TweenMax)

I used Vue-Cli + Vue-Router as the developing tools.

Inline SVG and HTML5 Canvas are responsible for the animations going on.

Greensock TweenMax Library was used for rendering the SVG animations in all the modern browsers.

** Intro SVG animation is rendered well on mobile devices but not responsive to the viewport resizing.
